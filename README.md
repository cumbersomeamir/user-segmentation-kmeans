# user-segmentation-kmeans


**1. Original Prompt**
Input: "What is quantum mechanics please explain"
2. Tokenization
Process: Break the sentence into individual words or tokens.
Output: ["What", "is", "quantum", "mechanics", "please", "explain"]
3. Removing Stop Words
Process: Remove common words that are usually irrelevant in analysis (like "what", "is", "please").
Output: ["quantum", "mechanics", "explain"]
4. Stemming
Process: Reduce words to their root form. For simplicity, let’s use stemming; lemmatization would require understanding part-of-speech which is a bit more complex.
Output: Assuming a simple stemmer that truncates based on common endings, it might still output ["quantum", "mechanic", "explain"], as these words do not change much with basic stemming rules. However, "mechanics" could potentially become "mechanic".
5. Vectorization
Process: Convert the processed text into a numerical format that a machine can understand. Let’s use TF-IDF as an example.
Example Description: Assume you have a collection of documents and the words "quantum", "mechanic", and "explain" appear in them with varying frequencies. TF-IDF will measure the frequency of each word in the document and adjust it based on how common the word is in the dataset, which helps to highlight words that are unique to a particular document.
Output: This would be a vector (array of numbers). Each position in the array corresponds to a word in the overall vocabulary of the dataset, with most values being 0 (meaning the word does not occur). For simplicity, let's say our entire vocabulary is ["quantum", "mechanic", "explain", "physics", "theory"], the vector might look like [0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0, 0]. The exact numbers depend on the TF-IDF calculations based on the dataset.
6. K-means Clustering
Process: Let's assume we're clustering this with other vectors from different documents. The algorithm will assign this vector to a cluster based on its proximity to the centroids of clusters that the algorithm calculates during its execution.
Output: Suppose it gets assigned to a cluster that includes other documents about physics and explanations.
7. Visualization (optional)
Process: If you're visualizing, you might reduce dimensionality via PCA or t-SNE and plot each document as a point in a 2D or 3D scatter plot.
Output: You see clusters visually on a plot, where similar documents cluster together.
